Description: This package creates emissions for use in air quality models.
  Vehicular emissions are estimated by a top-down approach, total emissions 
  are calculated using the statistical description of the fleet of vehicles, 
  the emission is spatially distributed according to georeferenced images, 
  shapefiles or data from the OpentreetMap and then distributed temporarily.
