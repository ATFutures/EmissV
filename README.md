## Top-down methods to create vehicular emissions.

Methods to create vehicular and other emissions by a top-down approach for use in numeric air quality models like [WRF-Chem](https://ruc.noaa.gov/wrf/wrf-chem/).

![Emissions using nocturnal lights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atmoschem/EmissV/master/example.jpg)

functions:

- read: read global inventories in netcdf format
- vehicles: tool to set-up vehicle data.table
- emissionFactor: tool to set-up emission factors data.table
- gridInfo: read grid information from a NetCDF file
- pointSource: emissions from point sources
- plumeRise: calculate plume rise (in progress)
- rasterSource: distribution of emissions by a georeferenced image
- lineSource: distribution of emissions by line vectors
- streetDist: distribution by OpenStreetnMap street (in progress)
- areaSource: distribution of emissions by region
- totalEmission: total emissions
- totalVOC: total VOCs emission
- emission: Emissions to atmospheric models

datasets:

- Perfil: vehicle counting profile for vehicular activity
- Sample of an image of persistent lights of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
- CETESB 2015 emission factors as ```emissionFactor(example=T)```
- DETRAN 2016 data and SP vahicle distribution as ```vehicles(example=T)```
- Shapefiles for Brasil states

## Packages needed

EmissV uses functions from this packages and will install automatically.

- [raster](http://cran.r-project.org/package=raster)
- [sp](https://github.com/edzer/sp/)
- [ncdf4](http://cran.r-project.org/package=ncdf4)
- [units](https://github.com/edzer/units/)
- [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table)
- [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)
- [spatstat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spatstat)
- [maptools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maptools)

The dependency of the packages [spatsts](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spatstat), [maptools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=maptools) and [sp](https://github.com/edzer/sp/) will be removed son.

## About this package

EmissV is a tool developed during Daniel Schuch's post-doctorate at the at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of SÃ£o Paulo ([IAG-USP](http://www.iag.usp.br/atmosfericas/)) supervised by professor Edmilson Dias de Freitas.
