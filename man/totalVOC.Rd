\title{Total VOCs emissions}
\format{Return a list with the daily total emission by territory.}
\usage{
totalVOC(v, ef, pol, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{dataframe with the vehicle data}

\item{ef}{emission factors}

\item{pol}{pollutant name in ef}

\item{verbose}{display adicional information}
}
\description{
cacule Volatile Organic Compounds (COVs) emited by the process of exaustao (through the exhaust pipe), liquid (carter and evaporative) and  vapor (fuel transfer operations).

 Avaliable VOCs are: eth, hc3, hc5, hc8, ol2, olt, oli, iso, tol, xyl, ket, ch3oh and ald
}
\note{
the same ef can be used to totalEmission and voc
